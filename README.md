##Mirone in Julia -- very WIP
Porting the venerable Mirone Matlab to Julia: [http://w3.ualg.pt/~jluis/mirone/](http://w3.ualg.pt/~jluis/mirone/)
<br>

## Installation

Prior to using this program, you must install `IUP` and `GMT` on your computer. You will need both the `IUP` and the two subsidiary libs `IM`  and `CD`.

To install `Mirone.jl`, do

  Pkg.clone("git@github.com:joa-quim/Mirone.jl.git")
  
## Using
Only tested on Windows where, so far, it only works a image and grid viewer.
